1. Follow the instructions on [this Github tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) for creating a pull request from a forked repository.

### Answer format
* These files are markdown files. If you're unfamiliar with markdown, check out [this resource](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to help you understand the way Github uses the markdown file format.
* Please provide sourcing and further reading for any answers to existing questions you submit.
* Please make sure to answer the question in a way that a beginner can understand. Using complex, nuanced language will make it more difficult for people to learn from the answer.
* If you're adding a question you were asked, it can be helpful to include which company asked the question
* Make sure to put your question into the correct file based on the category it covered.
    * If you can't decide on which category it should fit in to, you may either decide to create a new file representing that new category, or put the question in the `general-questions.md` file.

Thanks for your continuing help in keeping this list updated!
